Quite the year we've had for 2024.
Life in general has had plenty to offer, in short some points here:

* Son was born
* Learned a lot about AWS inner workings
* Cisco Network Switch configuration
* More of Rust
* Diablo 2 Resurrected, a childhood gem got replayed

Lots and lots of new topics or otherwise foreign subject to gather new information about (then somehow make use of all that information), the youngest (our latest production version of human) making most out of his first six months.

Loving the grind.
