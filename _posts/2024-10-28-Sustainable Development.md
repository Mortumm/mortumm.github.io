Personal and professional choices made in the light of sustainability and consumption reduction is a matter of principle for me. As a general aim for any service or product manufacturing process:  The driving forces along the actual original problem getting solved, is the choice of platform, tools and language in regard of energy consumption and sustainability.

In the general field of ICT, computational prowess has risen to such heights that the costs for performance or energy consumption are not in the first set of problems to solve.
(There are limited areas of production and product development where this is one the core problems.)
A fresh project or product rarely needs to take these issues into consideration first hand. Even the hardware we use daily (smartphones and PCs) contain so much raw processing power, that the idea of managing our compute consumption on personal level isn't even a concern.

I'm doing this by looking into the local and international possibilities to make these aspects a reality and continue researching the further possibilities to make an sustainability impact myself.

In short: Use C or Rust. Make conscious decisions on tooling and platform(s) of choice.
Keep it simple.
